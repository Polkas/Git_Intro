## DevOps - Agile 

DevOps, it basically means modern software development practices. 
DevOps has a few fundamental principles that most modern software projects follow. 
One of the key principles is to continuously plan, build and release small improvements to your product. 

Agile software development describes an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams

## DFS

A distributed version control system is a type of version control system.  
It usually has characteristics: 

- Each user has a local copy of the complete history of the project - repository. 
- Even though repositories are distributed among team members there's also a single remote repository that is designated as the source of truth or official state of the project.   hosted in a data center or in the cloud. 
- can  work while offline.  
- content is synchronized between repositories by pulling content from or pushing content to a remote repository. 

Git is a distributed version control system.

## Locations

- Working tree  
- Staging area/index  
- local repository  
- remote repository

## Git Objects

“plumbing” commands vs. “porcelain” commands

key-value data store

key - SHA-1 iow ID

```echo ""Hello World"" | git hash-object --stdin```
```echo ""Hello Worldd"" | git hash-object --stdin```

Commit
Annotated Tags
Tree 
Blob

## Git References

HEAD file is a symbolic reference to the branch you’re currently on. 
By symbolic reference, we mean that unlike a normal reference, it doesn’t generally contain a SHA-1 value but rather a pointer to another reference.

```~ ^```
```HEAD~~ or HEAD~5```

tags

```
git tag
git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"
git show v1.4
git tag -a v1.2 9fceb02
git push origin v1.5
git push origin --tags
```

Branch label is a reference that points to the tip of the branch
HEAD is a reference that points to the current commit


## Branches

A branch is a set of commits that trace back to the project's first commit. 
Creating a branch creates a branch label. Checkout involves updating the head reference and updating the working tree. 
A detached head reference points directly to a commit. 
Fix a detached head by creating a branch. Deleting a branch deletes a branch label.

## Merging

A fast-forward merge moves the base branch
label to the tip of the topic branch. A merge is fast-forwardable if no other
commits have been made to the base branch since the branch was created. 
A merge commit is the result of
combining the work of multiple commits. A merge commit has multiple parents.


## Resolving Merge Conflicts

## Tracking Branches

```
git branch
git branch --all
git log origin/master --oneline
```

## Fetch, Pull and Push

```
git fetch + git merge = git pull

git fetch + git reset --hard origin/master
```

```
git push
git push --force
```

## Rebasing

```
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

## Rewriting History



## Pull Requests 

The ultimate goal of a pull request is to merge a branch, but they also facilitate team discussion and
approval. You can open a pull request any
time after creating the branch, you do not need to edit the pull request
if you add a commit to the branch. You can merge the pull request
using an online Git host or by pushing the merge
from your local client.

## GIT WORK FLOWS

Git is very flexible and can be tailored
to many types of projects and teams. You can mix and match some of the workflow
ideas described in this video. We will start by discussing
centralized workflows. A centralized workflow uses a single
branch to accomplish the work of the project.
A down side of the centralized workflow
is that you are not taking advantage of features related to branching,
such as pull requests. Next we will discuss
the feature branch workflow.
